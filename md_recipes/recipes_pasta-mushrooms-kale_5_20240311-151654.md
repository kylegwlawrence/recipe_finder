## Cavatelli with Chicken Sausage and Kale

### Ingredients

#### Used ingredients
  
  - 2 13 oz packages cavatelli pasta  
  - 1 small bunch kale, rough chopped
#### Missed ingredients
  
  - 5 links chicken sausage  
  - 2 cloves of garlic, thinly sliced  
  - 3 cups vegetable broth
#### Unused ingredients
  
  - mushrooms
### Directions
  
  - Step 1: In a large pan, over medium high heat, add a drizzle of olive oil.  
  - Step 2: Add the sausage links and brown on each side, about 3 minutes a side. Do not worry if it isn't cooked through, it will finish cooking in a bit.  
  - Step 3: Remove from the pan and once cooled enough to handle, slice into rounds and set aside.In the same pan, over medium low heat, add another drizzle of olive oil and add the garlic and kale. Once the garlic is lightly golden add in the broth. Simmer for 15 minutes.While that is simmering go ahead and cook the pasta. I cooked mine in the pot of boiling water for only 4 minutes then drain it. I finish cooking it in the pan with the kale and sausage so they absorb the delicious flavors.Once the kale has simmered for 15 minutes go ahead and add the sausage back in and let simmer for another 5 minutes.Toss the cavatelli in and let cook for another 2-3 minutes.  
  - Step 4: Sprinkle some grated pecorino over top and enjoy!
