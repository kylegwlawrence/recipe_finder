## Curried Cabbage & Kale Gratin
  
Ready in 45 mins | Servings: 8
### Ingredients
  
  - 2 tbsp fat — my preference is always animal fat, such as tallow, chicken fat, duck fat or butter, but if you are going vegetarian route, olive oil will do nicely  
  - 2 slices of thick-cut bacon [totally optional], preferably not the strong flavored one, cut into 1/2″ wide strips  
  - 1 large leek, dark green parts removed, sliced in half lengthwise, rinsed out, and sliced about 1/4″ thick  
  - 3 cloves of garlic, slivered  
  - 1 tsp curry powder  
  - 1 small cabbage head, cored, quartered and sliced not too thin  
  - 1 bunch kale, I used Lacinato, coarsest parts of the stems discarded, the rest coarsely chopped  
  - 1/2 cup water for braising the cabbages  
  - salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste  
  - 2-3 sprigs of fresh thyme  
  - 3 large eggs  
  - 1/2 cup milk  
  - 1 cup white bread crumbs, I used Panko  
  - 1 cup grated Gruyere cheese, or similar  
  - 2 tbsp butter, melted, for topping
### Equipment
  
  - dutch oven  
  - frying pan  
  - whisk  
  - bowl  
  - oven  
  - casserole dish  
  - oven
### Instructions
  
  - Step 1: Heat the cooking fat in a large deep skillet or a Dutch oven, over medium heat
  
  - Step 2: Add bacon strips, leek and garlic at the same time and saute for a few minutes, until leeks are fragrant, and bacon is golden brown.
  
  - Step 3: Add curry spice and stir well to coat the onions and bacon.
  
  - Step 4: Add thyme and cabbage and saute for a few minutes, until cabbage releases some of the juice.
  
  - Step 5: Add kale and water. Stir everything very well, add salt and pepper, about 1/2 tsp each. Stir again and let cook over medium heat, until water evaporates and vegetables wilt nicely, and cabbage becomes translucent. It should still retain a bit of a light crunch.
  
  - Step 6: Remove from heat.
  
  - Step 7: Whisk eggs and milk in a separate bowl.
  
  - Step 8: Add about 1/2 cup bread crumbs and 1/2 the cheese. Stir well.
  
  - Step 9: Add egg mix to the cabbage mix and stir until well distributed.
  
  - Step 10: Heat the oven to 375F.
  
  - Step 11: In a casserole dish spread a handful of bread crumbs on the bottom.
  
  - Step 12: Fold out the gratin mix into the casserole and spread evenly.
  
  - Step 13: Coat with remaining cheese and bread crumbs uniformly.
  
  - Step 14: Drizzle melted butter on top.
  
  - Step 15: Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until top is nicely browned.
